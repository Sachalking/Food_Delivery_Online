# Foodpanda Clone Project

A Foodpanda-like food delivery web application built with **EJS**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. This project demonstrates a full‑stack solution with a responsive GUI (using Bootstrap), backend API logic, and persistent data storage.

## Features

- **Responsive UI:** Built with EJS templates and styled using Bootstrap.
- **Backend API:** Developed with Express to handle restaurant listings and order placements.
- **MongoDB Integration:** Data storage with Mongoose ODM.
- **Clean Project Structure:** Organized code with models, routes, views, and public assets.

## Project Structure


## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (install locally or use a hosted solution)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd foodpanda-clone

---

## Final Notes

1. **Testing the Project:**  
   • Ensure MongoDB is running on your machine or update your `.env` file with the correct connection string.  
   • Use the browser to navigate to the home page (shows restaurants) and the order page (submit an order).  
   • You can also test API endpoints using tools like Postman.

2. **Extensibility:**  
   This is a basic starting point. You can extend the models, add more routes, integrate user authentication, and improve the frontend as needed.

This complete setup should allow you to test the Foodpanda clone locally and serve as a solid foundation for further development. Happy coding!
